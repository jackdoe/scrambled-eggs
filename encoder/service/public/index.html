Why?
  Why not?

  I wanted to read phrack 49/14 again, phrack was big part of my
  childhood and thought me most I know today.

  When I wanted to read it on my phone, and as I opened the web page,
  all of a sudden I felt betrayed.

  Everything I do is being tracked and monitored, the clicks, every
  character I type, every scroll I do. Why? because I gave up ground,
  little by little, convenience here, nice restaurant recommendation
  there, small personalized messages here, now we are beyond the point
  of no return. Add my flight to the calendar automatically, sure, read
  my mail, no problem, automatically take meeting notes of course I
  would want that. Yes I want to have easy search in all git repositories.
  Who wouldn't want to use AI to correct their grammar? Text searching
  my photos sounds great. I love the Assistant movies, it is so
  personal, and the music is so nice.

  
  I betrayed myself.

  Scrambled Eggs lets me download files on my phone in airplane
  mode. It encodes data with qrcodes and then you can download through
  the camera with a special decoder.

  I just want to read phrack without the whole world knowing.. is it
  too much to ask?

  There are much easier ways to do this (like just downloading the
  file on your computer and then uploading it to your phone),
  but I felt really cool when I downloaded a file in airplane mode :D

  It is also extra funny now that GIFs are supported everywhere haha.

Speed?
  If you are lucky you can get to 20-30kbps, but usually you miss one
  frame from 30 and you have to wait the whole gif to rotate :(
  I believe I can speed it by playing the same gif with different rate
  next to each other and scan multiple qrcodes simultaneously.

Size?
  50kb text becomes about 300kb gif

How?      
  The format is as follows:
  
  the file is first compressed (xz, gzip, none are supported), then
  splitted into chunks of 2kb, after that each chunk is encoded with
  crc:base64(header):base64(data), and one extra frame is added with
  meta data, that contains header:base64(meta data).
  
  Everything is encoded as string so it is easy to use standard
  qrcode libraries.

<span id="format">frame format:</span>
  crc32:base64(header):base64(value)


crc32: this is the crc32 sum of (chunk type:chunk id:out of:value),
  because there are a lot of errors when reading qrcodes, we simply
  ignore the decoded result, and continue to scan, if the crc is mismatch

header:
  base64 encoded string version:chunkType:chunkId:outOf

  version: at the moment it is 0

  chunk type:
    1: DATA, the following frame contains data
    0: META, the following frame contains meta data
    
  chunk id: this is simply the index of the chunk, if the encoded file
    is 100kb and we have 2kb chunks, we will have 100/2 chunks to "download"
    
  out of: number that specifies how long is the data, used for progress bar
  
value: this is base64 encoded binary

---

DATA VALUE:
  data frames simply concatenate all decoded values into a binary

---

META-DATA VALUE:
  name:sha:totalCount:contentType:totalSize:compressionType

name: string, the file name
sha: string, the file's sha256 printed as hex string
totalCount: int, total number of chunks, redundant as the value in the header
contentType: string, mime content type of the data
totalSize: int, size in bytes
compression: string that is one of gzip,xz or none

the data is also padded with "*", so make sure to do
value.replace("*","")

(main reason for the extra padding is so the bar-code are not very
different in size, and it is easier to be decoded one after the other)

<span id="example_decoder">Example decoder pseudocode:</span>

  pieces := map[int][]byte
  totalPieces, sha
  for {
      barcodeString := decodeBarcode()
      splitted := strings.SplitN(barcodeString, ":",5)
      // compare the crc32 with the rest of the frame
      // crc32:(chunk type:chunk id:out of:value)
      if (crc32(splitted[1:..]) != itoa(splitted[0]))
         continue // if mismatching, ignore
      
      byte[] data = base64decode(splitted[4])
      type := atoi(splitted[1])
      
      // if the chunk type is DATA, colect it
      if (type == 1)
          pieces[atoi(splitted[2])] = data
      else if type == 1 {
          meta := strings.Split(":",string(data))
          totalPieces = atoi(meta[2])
          sha = meta[...
          filename = ..
          content type = ..
      }
      if totalPieces > 0 && len(pieces) == totalPieces {
          whole = join all bytes from the pieces (in index order)
          check if the sha matches
          decompress
          break
      }
  }

<span id="android">Android app:</span>
  you can fork it on github, install flutter and do flutter run \
  --release to upload it on your phone, maybe soon I will release it
  to the playstore

  <img src="screenshots/1.png">
  <img src="screenshots/2.png">

  you can also download the app from the <a href=" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.scrambledeggs.unscramble">google playstore</a>
  (in process of publishing, you can download the <a href=" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scrambledeggs.unscramble">old</a> version)

<span id="ios">iOS app:</span>
  work in progress, but since I sold my macbook I have to setup xcode
  on hacky vmware macos image..Apple wont approve the app anyway.

<hr>
<form id="upload" action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
Scramble your own file: <input type="file" name="file"> <input type="submit" value="Scramble">
(max size 100kb, you can also clone the repo and build encoder/cmd)
</form>
<hr>
<span id="example">Examples:</span><br>
<div>  <span>phrack 49/14:</span> <a href="e/49-14.gif"><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="e/49-14.gif" width=500></a></div>
<div>  <span>the first principle koan:</span> <a href="e/first-koan.gif"><img style="vertical-align:middle" src="e/first-koan.gif"></a></div>
<div>  <span><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/fxhEVLYtzqkibch1Mq">Heart of Darkness</a> (from Project Gutenberg)</a></span></div>
  (make sure you focus on only one of the images, otherwise you will
  get conflicts)

<span id="todo">TODO:</span>
  * try encoding few small bar-codes instead of one big
  * try to use multiple colors overlay-ed, and filter on the camera
  * use some ML to predict which images are hard to decode and delay
    them more when making the gif
  * add non text viewer in the app
  * make the app render non 80 char text (not sure about that)
  * add UUID in the file, so multiple files can be scanned in the same
    time
  * once the app is released add url to dowlonad it as a qrcode :D
  * change the format to include some kind of uuid so multiple fies
    can be donwloaded in the same time
